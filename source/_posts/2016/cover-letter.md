# Hands on with a real example

The rest of this blog post will focus on a job advert for a [Technical Lead, Center for Civic Media](http://www.media.mit.edu/about/opportunities/technical-lead-center-civic-media) at the MIT Media Lab.

This job advert is very relevant to me and my work at [BBC R&D](http://bbc.co.uk/rd). As the MIT Media Lab does not sponsor working visa, I literally have no chance to get it so I do not consider this exercise as a conflictual matter of fact.

The idea is to walk you through the application as I would apply to it in the real world.

## Description

> The Media Cloud project (http://mediacloud.org) is seeking a technical lead to help us build tools that facilitate research about the role of digital media in civic discourse. Media Cloud is an open source and open data project that produces its own research about the networked public sphere and also facilitates others' research about online media by making available to the public its existing archive of more than 365 million stories and by collecting more than 300,000 new stories daily. The technical lead will drive all technical aspects of the project, working with the principal research scientist that leads the research team to plan, design, build, and run all levels of the project's platform -- back end tools that collect and archive the platform's data, researcher tools that enable analysis of that data, and front end tools that expose the data and analysis to the public. This is a unique opportunity to both shape the concept and contribute to the hands-on development of tools.
>
> Media Cloud is a joint project between the Center for Civic Media at MIT and the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. The position will be based at the Center for Civic Media, but the technical lead will work closely with members of the team from both centers. The project is funded by human rights foundations, for whom we produce both the open platform and research that helps them making decisions about how best to influence online civic conversations about democracy, activism, and health.
>
> We are a diverse team of researchers and technologists who love to wrestle with hard questions about online media by using a combination of social, computer, and data sciences. The ideal candidate will work well with all members of the team, from the principal research scientist to junior developers, and will thrive in an academic atmosphere that encourages constant questioning and validation at all levels of the platform and of our research products.
>
> Much of our substantive work focuses on issues of gender, race, and globalization. We strongly encourage women, people of color, and people of any sexual identity to apply.
>
> The job is based in Cambridge, MA, but much of our team is distributed around the world. We are open to flexible onsite working arrangements.
>
> This is a one-year appointment with the possibility of extension.
