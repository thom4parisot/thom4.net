What 2015 looked like, **every day**, in picture(s).

<!--more-->

**Every day** is a photography series I started in 2013 in order to fight my fear of having habits. It has been designed as a daily ritual: one picture from a fixed location, **every day I woke up at home** paired with a **written memory**.

# 2015

- **224** days at home
- **141** days somewhere else:
	- one month in Ukraine
	- some days in Guernesey and Sark
	- some days in England (Brighton, Blenheim, Lewes, Southend-on-Sea, Manchester)
	- some weeks in France (Lyon, Paris, Bordeaux, Montpellier, Toulouse, Saint-Malo, Honfleur, Bayeux, Bec-Hellouin, Rennes, Nantes, Le Mans, Saint-Étienne)
- lived in **1** city
- lived in **2** places:
	- King's Cross
	- Tottenham

The figures denote I woke up at home *4 days less* compared to 2014.
It also surfaces I have been to fewer places in England and in Europe although I travelled to a more diverse set of locations in France. First time in Normandy. First time in Brittany.

*Note*: Instagram silently **removed the grid lines** camera feature on Android at some point. It took me a couple of days/weeks to refine the process and eventually end up using the normal Android camera first, then Instagram to edit and publish.


# Montage

The video cover design is rendered in an HTML5 compatible web browser, with the help of [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/). The code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/oncletom/everyday-sequence/blob/0e5cd9b1b20023eb6cdd974a41db52c111b8419f/src/renderers/sequence-faded.js#L30-L51).

*Note to self*: I would have loved to be able to extract each slice of pixels from a combination of geometric shapes and  streamed images in multiple [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API). The result would have been assembled in a single canvas.

The [video is assembled exactly as in 2014](/2014/everyday#How_I_made_it).

# 2016?

2016 is about **going beyond** and **pace**.

**Every day** in *2015* • [2014](/2014/everyday/) • [2013](/2013/everyday/).
