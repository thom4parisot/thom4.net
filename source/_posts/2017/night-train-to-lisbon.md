**Sceneries of rounded hills** can be seen through the large windows of the carriage. We now pass the Atlantic side of the Pyr√©n√©es. And my eyes now wander on the pages of a paper companion of mine, [The Storyteller][notes-storyteller] by _Walter Benjamin_.

As boarding on a **_twenty_ hours train journey** was not unusual enough, I also decided to carry my bike over this **2000km journey** between _Paris_ and _Azenhas do Mar_ ‚Äì a little town a bit far of _Lisbon_ and _Sintra_, in Portugal.

Today we are Sunday June 18th 2017; the first Sunday of summer. The daylight will start to dim sooner and sooner every day. I woke up near  _Entroncamento_. The train was still on the move between Ir√∫n and Lisbon, between the France/Spain border and the western edge of Europe.

I boarded on this journey thanks to [Claude](https://twitter.com/glovesmore). One day, you told me about your train journey from Bordeaux to Lisbon. "_Just_" for the week-end. I _did not_ understand why you spent more time on a train rather than visiting the final destination itself.
But I understood you loved it. This entire experience. You even wrote a song out of it,  _Railroad Club_. About your need _to feel true to yourself_ and to take **the one last night train** to _Santa Apolonia_.

It was a while ago but I wanted to meet with your song. To experience your long-winded tale. To twist it by travelling with a bicycle. To see if a long intercontinental journey by train was nicer than a quick hop between two airplane runways.

# An Ode to the Slow Time

It seems obvious to me than a train trip would always be nicer over a plane one. It seems obvious than a 2.5 hours journey is shorter than a 20 hours one. And it would be natural to favour the shortest journey, the fastest one.

I remember waiting on the platform of the _Ir√∫n_ train station. The sun was heavily baking the pavement. And I have rarely seen such a large but deserted train station. It felt abnormal.

Coach 20, seat 5B, by the window. A middle-aged man is waving over at his relatives through the window. I feel sympathy for him. Maybe we are both unaware of where we are really going. Another man is making attempts to take a perfect selfie.

People would board in or step out as we stop in various train stations. Some of the city names sound familiar to me. A few peeps would smoke in between the carriages, thus infuriating the ticket controller. Other people would go and sit at the counter of the restaurant carriage. To have a sandwich. To enjoy a full course meal. To have some drinks and chat with their friends or someone they befriended earlier on.

I remember witnessing a _touring bike_ boarding the carriage at 11pm. It was not yet fully dark outside. The bike was followed by the tired but happy face of her owner. She later told me she started her journey in Germany a few weeks ago. She only stopped in this isolated town in Spain, thousands of kilometers away from her home in order to make it a bit quicker to visit her sister on time in Lisbon. The ticket controllers were in panic: she did not follow the rules. Nobody was atuned on what _exactly_ the rules were supposed to be. She was asked to leave, in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere, no matter what. We managed to negotiate, by showing she was trying to respect the rules as much as possible.

I also remember that woman who _screamed_ and _shouted_ in our carriage at 3am. Hailing at everybody. Pinching the buttocks of the ticket controller as he diligently requested some silence ‚Äî indeed, we were secretly hoping to enjoy some silence too. This is when the puppy started to scream too. The lady and her son were kicked out at the next train station. I felt the painful flow of emotions of the young man-to-be, standing still on the platform, his right hand palm covering his face. The carriages claimed their _motion_ back.

I remember seeing some familiar things on the way back. The face of the barmen. The mountains. The wheat fields. Some train stations panels. A bright red coat. Some places I would like to visit. Some places I asked myself if I would live there some day. The sight of the ocean through San Sebastian high street.

I remember nothing from a plane journey. Maybe some clouds, sometimes.

# Travelling with a bicycle

The outbound journey was composed of several legs.

![](/images/2017/08/bike-suburban-train.jpg)

## Paris ‚Üí Hendaye

* Cost: `86‚Ç¨`
* Distance: 802km
* Company: **SNCF**
* Service: **IDTGV** (low cost high speed train)
* Bike fare: **no**

üëç Travelling with a bike is widely accepted as long as it is kept in a **bike travel bag**.

üëé I had to let the bike next to the carriage doors because no space was available.

## Hendaye ‚Üí Ir√∫n

* Cost: `0‚Ç¨` (well, not really)
* Distance: 3km
* Company: **SNCF** (an alternate service is provided by a local company)
* Service: **TGV**
* Bike fare: **yes**

üòè My _IDTGV_ final destination was _Hendaye_ but it happened that the front leading carriages were operated by another company. I _sneaked in_ the front train to stop a handful kilometers down the line.

üëé Most of the journey planners overlook this tiny rail segment, making it hard to book the journey in one go.

üëç Kudos [_Rome2Rio_ to have shown me the truth](https://www.rome2rio.com/en/s/Paris/Lisbonne)!

## Ir√∫n ‚Üí Lisbon Oriente

* Cost: `69‚Ç¨` (`41‚Ç¨` inbound)
* Distance: ~1100km
* Company: **Renfe**
* Service: **Trenhotel** (sleepers train)
* Bike fare: **no**

üëé It is not nice to be threatened of being kicked out in the middle of a multi-leg trip.

üëé Because train controllers change during the trip (at the Spain/Portugal border), you have to convince them _twice_.

üëé Being told to book a ~100‚Ç¨ sleeper fare (+40‚Ç¨ minimum) "just" to carry a bike sounds like a very unreasonable alternative.

üëç An arrangement is possible based on your negociating skills.

## Lisbon Oriente ‚Üí Portela de Sintra

* Cost: `2.20‚Ç¨`
* Distance: 27km
* Company: **CP**
* Service: **Urban**
* Bike fare: **included**

üëç Travelling with a bike is totally okay.

## Portela de Sintra ‚Üí Azenhas do Mar

* Cost: `3.30‚Ç¨`
* Distance: 13.9km
* Company: **Scotturb**
* Service: **Bus 440**/**Bus 441**
* Bike fare: **included**

üëç Travelling with a bike was okay. The bus driver was cooperative, I guess as long as there was enough space left for people to come in.

# Reading Notes from _The Storyteller_

This essay written by _Walter Benjamin_ is short but gave me strong takeaways. _Walter Benjamin_ is one of my favourite thinker and writer. I found these writings right at a moment I was thinking about the **importance of shared experience** _and_ about the **"learner/teacher" & "pull/push" patterns** ‚Äî I can't find a better translation of "sachant / apprenant" for now.

**Sharing an experience has a more potential to be remembered** than theoretical content (bored at school? You know why now). Mostly because we can forget about ourselves, hook onto the story and relate to it with our feelings.

**Something that is deeply experienced can be shared and told again**. This is something I really understood only this year about _agile practices_: the techniques you experience once and can be applied right after are the most valuable ones.

**A shared experience is transformative**. [When I attended Sud Web in May](/2017/dear-sudweb/), I experienced the [fishbowl technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)). And I have been able to reuse it right after, both enjoying it and being reassured that talkative persons would not take over a group discussion.

**Being available**, being able **to listen** and being able **to onboard** someone into something they have no idea how to get started **is more transformative** than ~~mansplaining~~ giving a bunch of advice. Just by showing it is doable, and even enjoyable.

Another example of a transformative shared experience is how people get started with cycling. For a couple of years I would not cycle in London "because it was dangerous". One day someone introduced me to cycling in South London and I ended up buying a bike a few weeks after.
Months later, I introduced [No√©mie](http://noemiegirard.co/) to cycling in Paris. **We would go at her pace with no time pressure**. She eventually bought a bike ([thank you Leboncoin](https://www.leboncoin.fr/)) and started cycling in London. A colleague of hers was feeling underwhelmed by her commute by bus. They shared a bike ride together and I let you guess what will happen to this person, bike wise ü§ì

You can find more [reading notes of the Storyteller][notes-storyteller] ‚Äî they are written in French though. _Reading Notes_ is a _new section_ over here I intend to develop as a way to share my notes in the margin of the books I read. They are living documents which will evolve over time as I make connections betweens thoughts and readings.

# Conclusion

Now I understand what you found in _Santa Apolonia_. You got your space, you got your time to think and came back with a tune to remember this experience for a very long time.
This is a way for us to face ourselves, our fears; to look at them, to look into our own eyes, to view through our fears.

**Travelling with a bike can be a total mess**. Most of the inconvenience is due to uneven bike facilities on board of the trains. Each service has a **different communication** (when they _dare_ advertising bicycle informations ‚Äî _wink wink_ [Renfe](http://www.renfe.com/)), **different acceptance** (bike bags, unpredictable carriage equipments) and **different booking options**: Renfe requires you to book _an entire sleeper cabin_ (to bloody store a bike!) whereas you cannot even buy a complementary bike reservation on a TGV service beyond the initial booking.

[Speaking at Write the Docs in _Prague_][wtd2017] will be a perfect excuse to (re)iterate an intercontinental journey. Only for _fifteen hours_ this time but without a bike ‚Äì crossing _5 countries_ would certainly be too much of a pain in the neck üò•.
