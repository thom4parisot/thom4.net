2013 has been even less predictable than the past years.
The only event I could have predicted is I would turn 30 years old.

I would have never imagined trading a 100m^2 flat for a 16m^2 room.
I would have never imagined leaving France for UK two weeks after a successful job application.
I would have never imagined working for the BBC and being able to bring something valuable: **culture** and **identity**.

2013 has been another year full of destructuring for a better regeneration. On top of the legacy, not against it.

## Loops and Patterns

(re)discovered “In C” from Terry Riley.

## Habbits

Had to recreate them. Carrying them overseas.
i

## Fraud and Normality

Everything I did was normal to me, and I aknowledge everybody around me is better than me.


## Leaving Things/People/Memories

- classical but true: realising what is left over
- most essentially the *why*, intrinsic reasons

## It’s About Time

- became a visible fundation of my thoughts since the 6th of December 2012
- one year running the [Same Place, Everyday](http://everyday.oncletom.io), revealing interesting patterns
- every minute I use is an investment for the Future


## A New Shore, A New Culture

- small geographical gap: nap distance, huge change of habits
- not what I imagined, especially as it’s tight to internal catalysts (low barriers, culture of sharing, good food culture)
- learned the pleasure of hugging meaningful persons
- hard sometimes to show out things, when not understood
- discovered the effect of a constraint personnality: I can’t express myself with the same accuracy, the same speed and the same understanding

## Acceptance (Resilience?) - Around

- everything will not become what I prefer
- especially the British politeness which can cause a lot of personal frustration (which reduces possible feedbacks and increases unwanted loneliness)
- impossible to accept that if not pushing the self acceptance

## Acceptance - Inbound (?)

- gained back the vision
- paying attention to small details, what people express about me
- trying to ditch own representation of the self
- unleashed creativity
- I’m not the best technician, and I start getting on that, ignoring this secret wish of becoming a new shining rockstar (it’s tempting to think it’s going to solve *our* problems)
- *my* skills are here, in programming, but for other purposes than the sole sake of programming. This is ephemeral.

What remains of technology and evolution? People. Nature.

Has technology or tools ever solved problems? They certainly helped.

## Focusing on the Self

- doing what I want, “whatever the cost is” (the cost can be the reward and the lesson, too easy to say/write)
- revealing myself through making picture
- understanding what is motivation, satisfaction
- sharing again, more
- learning, more even if not enough

## Photography

- first developed film
- first printed photography film
- night courses helped me connecting the dots, figuring out intuitions

## Small Life Iterations

- whereas it is related to travels, projects
- small rewards but on the long term, big benefits of planting seeds sooner

## What’s Next For 2014?

- it’s about making an impact
- the meaning of doing
