[Reasons to be Creative 2013](http://reasons.to/) is over. This was my first time. Attending this conference. Going to Brighton. Camping and hiking there.

**I have been happily surprised by the crowd**, and here is why.

## tl;dr

The strong talks at the **Reasons to be Creative** were focused on going out of the comfort zone, getting confidence at drawing your own path and pairing/mentoring with relevant people.

## About Reasons to be Creative

[Reasons to be Creative 2013](http://reasons.to/) is a 3 days multi-track yearly conference. It aims to balance between creative design and creative programming.

It has a fairly strong panel of speakers, and even the sponsored talks are proper enough not to be boring. Better, they can be interesting too! (*loved* the Nokia alarm clock ringtone evolution).

## Breaking the Speed of the Metropolis

Attending the conference was also a good way to break the speed of London. This is a subject which bothers me since a couple of weeks, as I struggle catching up with Time, and achieving at doing all I want to do.

**London has almost too many things to offer**.
And being surrounded by stormy-thinking people does not help to rest.

I left the laptop at home. Turned off the phone. Bought a map and walked for hours on sparsely crowded trails. **It gave me the mood to make pictures**. A thing which never happens to me in London.

[Since I travelled to Iceland](http://www.flickr.com/photos/the-jedi/sets/72157631659580458/), it seems I also became picky on my satisfaction at capturing landscape. Again, I realise how beautiful *every single angle* from any viewpoint was.

On monday morning, **I was already rested** and ready to enjoy people talking and sharing their knowledge.

## Getting Inspired By Them

Some speakers were really mind-blowing. Because **they were simple at explaining complex subjects**. Because they were joyful at speaking about them.

As a way to say **thank you**, I made and offered a picture of themselves. A gift of the *Now*. Something I'll never possess. Something they will own:

* [Eva-Lotta Lamm](http://sketchnotesbook.com/)
For breaking my fear of drawing and providing strong basics of sketching.
* [Dominic Wilcox](http://dominicwilcox.com/the-book/)
For making variations… normal.
* [Stefan Sagmeister](http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/)
For documenting your quest of happiness, and acknowledging that commuting is creating unhappiness — wake up London!
* [Brad Frost](http://vimeo.com/56164296)
For aiming at the bullshit surrounding (and generated by) us.
* [Hellicar & Lewis](http://www.hellicarandlewis.com/)
For [open sourcing your digital art](https://github.com/HellicarAndLewis) with the crowd.

## Next Year?

There are **definitely reasons to attend next year**. Especially as [James Victore](https://twitter.com/JamesVictore) is speaking.

Until then, I'll *water the seeds* exchanged [with](https://twitter.com/electric_g) [some](http://kongur.co.uk/) [people](http://danrubin.is).

And, **thank *you***!
