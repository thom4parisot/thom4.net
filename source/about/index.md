My name is Thomas Parisot, I design web software — its code, its governance, its usage — as part of the [dtc innovation][] co-op.
We created this small and safe environment to design valuable projects with our customers.

People often call me *Tom*.
My long lasting nickname *Oncle Tom* is a friendly pun to our *digital slavery*.

## Values

I have discovered **four foundational values**. Violating them makes me feel I'm doing the wrong thing.

* **Nature** is a call for observation, peace, life and what prevails above all;
* **Love** drives a generosity and tenderness towards animals and persons I encounter;
* **Autonomy** is what I look for for myself — understanding and being able to accomplish — I also want it for the persons I work with to deflect a dependency on me;
* **Commons** are the result of a shared work, governance and right of use of a software, its data and its documented history.

Thus, I will do my best to favour **non-profit**, **ethical** or **greater good** projects and organisations.

## Paid Work

I have **more than 15 years of professional experience**, self-taught with the help of the many people I met on my way.

- Software designer at [dtc innovation][];
- Senior web engineer at [BBC R&D][];
- CTO and co-founder of [Dijiwan, a startup which failed](/2014/why-our-startup-failed/);
- Web consultant in my own limited company;
- Web consultant at [Clever Age][], a renowned French Web engineering agency;
- Web developer in a nation-wide retail group.

## Generous Work

I do volunteering work and **give away time to organisations I would like to contribute**. I use this as a way to learn and explore but also as a way to defuse return on investment expectations.

Here are some organisations I have spent time with

- [Revue S!lence](http://revuesilence.net/){lang=fr}
- [Les Pains de Beaufort](http://www.painsdebeaufort.com/){lang=fr}
- [Festival Printemps d'InPACT](https://latelierpaysan.org/Le-printemps-d-InPACT-2018){lang=fr}
- [Sud Web][]{lang=fr}
- [Organic Lea farm][]{lang=en}


## Can we get in touch?

You can [drop me a line at anytime][email], although I can be slow to reply when things get agitated on my side of things.

I'm happy to meet you in person if we happen to be at the same place at the same time. It does not have to be good match. Life is life.

If you're unsure or think you are not legitimate, feel free [to send me a short email][email] 🙂
